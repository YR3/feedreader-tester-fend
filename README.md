## Feed Reader Testing

### Project Overview
An Existing web app that reads RSS feeds was provided for me by [Udacity.](http://udacity.com/) I was responsible of writing a test suite to check various functionalities of the Feed Reader App.
## Project Instructions

In order to run the application you can:

* Download as .zip file

Afterwards, open the `index.html` and scroll down to the end of the page to check the test results.


## Specs

 - A test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
 - A test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
 - A test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
